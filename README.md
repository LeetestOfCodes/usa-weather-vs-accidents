# usa-weather-vs-accidents
A two-person project that works through an expansive weather vs. car accidents dataset to establish a link between precipitation and car accident frequency.

# Crucial Work Distribution Note
This was a project that was done in equal, 50-50 distribution of tasks between myself and coauthor of this project, @PromitHossain.
